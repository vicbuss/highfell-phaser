# Highfell Phaser

## Premise:

This project was born of a desire to automate the process of tracking the megadungeon Highfell from [Greg Gillespie's amazing book](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/277804/HighFell-The-Drifting-Dungeon) for my own game.

It will take a number of "periods" and calculate Highfell's trajectory for each period, following the module's rules, and recording the dungeon's position in each period: using a number for hexes in the material plane, or the name of the demi-plane its in.

A "period" represents the amount of time it takes Highfell to travel from one hex to the next. 

One minor change from the rules is that Highfell will spend from 2-8 periods in a demi-plane, instead of 1-4 days. This was done to simplify the math and make it simpler to track its movement across time. This will mean that either Highfell travels through one hex in 12 hours instead of 10, or that it spends from 20-80h in a demi-plane.
